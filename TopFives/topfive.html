      <p> Yamaha guitars is one of my favorite items as they make high quality instruments. The 
        guitars have added technology like tuners and sound controls. Yamaha was the brand I learned 
        how to play on so it always reminds me of childhood.</p>

      <p> From running to casual shoes, nike is the shoe brand I would choose. Since I have
        wide feet the shoes fit the shape of my foot really well. Additionally the designs 
        are sleak and basic.
