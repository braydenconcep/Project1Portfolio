    <p>Hey everyone! I'm a student-athlete here at San Francisco State University
      on the wrestling team. I'm a third-year majoring in Visual Communication Design.
      Born and raised in San Diego, California I came to San Francisco to still be in
      California but see a change of scenery. Growing up in a family of six, with most 
      of my extended family in San Diego as well made me appreciated having my whole family 
      in one area.I'm a Filpino-American that takes pride in the Pinoy culture, especially 
      with food and clothing. If I'm not eating burritos or chicken, you can usually see me
      eating traditional Filipino food like sinigang. I would say I'm a big food guy, who loves
      to try different food and attempt to cook. In my free time, I love trying new things. 
      Some things I have gotten into is playing guitar, learning to golf, and trying different
      outdoor activities. With a busy schedule with managing classes, practices, and tournaments
      it may seem like I don't have much free time. But, in my free time, I like to go on drives, 
      listen to music, or even go to the gym. I'm a aspiring Graphic Designer or Social Media 
      manager who seeks to learn as much as I can in the design field.
