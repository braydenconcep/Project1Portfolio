    <p>
      Hey everyone! I'm a student-athlete here at San Francisco State University
      on the wrestling team. I'm a third-year majoring in Visual Communication
      Design. Born and raised in San Diego, California I came to San Francisco
      to still be in California but see a change of scenery. Growing up in a
      family of six, with most of my extended family in San Diego as well made
      me appreciated having my whole family in one area. I'm a Filpino-American
      that takes pride in the Pinoy culture, especially with food and clothing.
      If I'm not eating burritos or chicken, you can usually see me eating
      traditional Filipino food like sinigang. I would say I'm a big food guy,
      who loves to try different food and attempt to cook. In my free time, I
      love trying new things. Some things I have gotten into is playing guitar,
      learning to golf, and trying different outdoor activities. With a busy
      schedule with managing classes, practices, and tournaments it may seem
      like I don't have much free time. But, in my free time, I like to go on
      drives, listen to music, or even go to the gym. I'm a aspiring Graphic
      Designer or Social Media manager who seeks to learn as much as I can in
      the design field.
