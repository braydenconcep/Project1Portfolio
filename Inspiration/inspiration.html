    <p> I find Bruno Mars inspiring as he is also
      a Filipino artist and makes songs that relate 
      to my personal life. His voice is rare and you
      don't here voices like his often.

    <p>Brandon Lake is another artist that inspires me because
      he is a Christian singer, songwriter. A lot of his music
      speaks to me to follow my faith.

    <p> Zach Bryan is the last artist that inspires me
      as his music is country but more story telling. Most of 
      his music is relatable and gets me through tough times.
